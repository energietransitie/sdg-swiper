This involves promoting sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to improve agricultural productivity.','iconUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/goals/E_SDG_Icons-02.jpg','thumbnailUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/themes/custom/porto/assets/goals/images/img-goal-2.jpg','backgroundColor':'#dda73a'},{'id':'f8003b18-3687-4c8d-9f80-08dad3b148dc','number':3,'title':'Good health and well-being','description':'Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the two. It takes into account widening economic and social inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to the climate and the environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable diseases. Universal health coverage will be integral to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequalities. Emerging global health priorities not explicitly included in the SDGs, including antimicrobial resistance, also demand action.','iconUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/goals/E_SDG_Icons-03.jpg','thumbnailUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/themes/custom/porto/assets/goals/images/img-goal-3.jpg','backgroundColor':'#4c9f38'},{'id':'ea45fd08-9ff5-423b-9f81-08dad3b148dc','number':4,'title':'Quality education','description':'Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development.

Promoting sustainable industries, and investing in scientific research and innovation, are all important ways to facilitate sustainable development. More than 4 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, and 90 percent are from the developing world. Bridging this digital divide is crucial to ensure equal access to information and knowledge, as well as foster innovation and entrepreneurship.

A large share of the world population is still consuming far too little to meet even their basic needs.  Halving the per capita of global food - and water - waste at the retailer and consumer levels is also important for creating more efficient production and supply chains. This can help with food security, and shift us towards a more resource efficient economy.','iconUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/goals/E_SDG_Icons-12.jpg','thumbnailUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/themes/custom/porto/assets/goals/images/img-goal-12.jpg','backgroundColor':'#bf8d2c'},{'id':'54e63bb5-d0fb-4d65-9f8a-08dad3b148dc','number':13,'title':'Climate action','description':'There is no country that is not experiencing the drastic effects of climate change. Supporting vulnerable regions will directly contribute not only to Goal 13 but also to the other SDGs. These actions must also go hand in hand with efforts to integrate disaster risk measures, sustainable natural resource management, and human security into national development strategies. It is still possible, with strong political will, increased investment, and using existing technology, to limit the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, aiming at 1.5°C, but this requires urgent and ambitious collective action.','iconUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/goals/E_SDG_Icons-13.jpg','thumbnailUrl':'https://sdgs.un.org/themes/custom/porto/assets/goals/images/img-goal-13.jpg','backgroundColor':'#407f46'},{'id':'84fa432e-4262-4d26-9f8b-08dad3b148dc','number':14,'title':'Life Below Water','description':'The SDGs aim to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems from pollution, as well as address the impacts of ocean acidification.
